# /plan - Planner Mode - Deep Analysis and Strategic Planning

Enter comprehensive planning mode for complex development tasks with thorough analysis, clarifying questions, and structured implementation planning.

## What this command does:

### Deep Reflection and Analysis Process

1. **Comprehensive Code Analysis**
   - Maps the full scope of changes needed across the codebase
   - Identifies dependencies, integrations, and potential impacts
   - Analyzes existing patterns and architectural considerations
   - Reviews related components, services, and data flows

2. **Strategic Planning Assessment**
   - Evaluates multiple implementation approaches
   - Considers technical constraints and project requirements
   - Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies
   - Plans for scalability and maintainability

3. **Memory Bank Integration**
   - Reviews all Memory Bank files for project context
   - Ensures alignment with existing project patterns
   - Considers documented system architecture and decisions
   - Validates approach against established technical context

### Interactive Clarification Process

**Before proposing any plan, asks 4-6 targeted clarifying questions based on findings:**

- **Scope Questions**: Exact boundaries and requirements
- **Technical Questions**: Implementation preferences and constraints
- **Integration Questions**: Dependencies and system interactions
- **Priority Questions**: Timeline, importance, and trade-offs
- **Context Questions**: Business logic and user experience considerations
- **Architecture Questions**: Design patterns and structural decisions

### Structured Plan Development

After clarifying questions are answered:

1. **Comprehensive Plan Creation**
   - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable phases
   - Defines clear deliverables and success criteria
   - Establishes logical dependency order
   - Estimates complexity and effort for each phase

2. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Detailed step-by-step approach
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Testing and validation approaches
   - Documentation and knowledge transfer plans

3. **Approval and Execution**
   - Presents complete plan for user approval
   - Allows for plan modifications based on feedback
   - Once approved, implements ALL steps systematically
   - Provides progress updates after each phase completion

### Progress Tracking and Communication

- **Phase Completion Updates**: What was just completed
- **Next Steps Clarity**: What's coming next in the workflow
- **Remaining Phases**: Overview of work still to be done
- **Milestone Celebrations**: Recognition of significant progress

## Usage:

Type `/plan` in the chat when you need comprehensive planning for complex development tasks.

## Best Use Cases:

- **Complex Feature Implementation**: Multi-component features with dependencies
- **System Refactoring**: Large-scale code restructuring projects
- **Integration Projects**: Connecting multiple systems or services
- **Architecture Changes**: Significant structural modifications
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-faceted performance improvement initiatives
- **Migration Projects**: Technology or framework migrations

## Key Features:

- ✅ **Deep Analysis** - thorough examination of existing codebase
- ✅ **Strategic Questioning** - targeted clarifications before planning
- ✅ **Memory Bank Integration** - leverages documented project knowledge
- ✅ **Structured Approach** - organized phases with clear deliverables
- ✅ **Risk Assessment** - identifies and plans for potential issues
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - clear communication throughout execution
- ✅ **Approval Process** - ensures alignment before implementation

## Expected Output:

1. **Analysis Summary**: Current state and scope assessment
2. **Clarifying Questions**: 4-6 targeted questions for requirements
3. **Comprehensive Plan**: Detailed phase-by-phase implementation strategy
4. **Approval Request**: Clear plan presentation for user confirmation
5. **Systematic Execution**: Step-by-step implementation with progress updates

## Example Planning Topics:

- "Plan a new user authentication system with OAuth integration"
- "Plan migration from Redux to Zustand state management"
- "Plan implementation of real-time notifications across the platform"
- "Plan performance optimization for the workflow canvas rendering"
- "Plan integration of new payment processing system"

## Planning Principles:

- **Thorough Before Fast**: Deep analysis prevents costly mistakes
- **Question Before Assume**: Clarify requirements to avoid rework
- **Plan Before Code**: Strategic approach improves implementation quality
- **Communicate Progress**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout execution
